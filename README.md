###User Stories
1. As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.
2. As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.
3. As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.
4. As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.
